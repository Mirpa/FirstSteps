                The arrival of autumn brings with it the arrival of new colors.<br><br>
                As time goes by, the leaves of the trees turn brown and 
                orange, until they fall off. The colors of summer fruits disappear from the markets to make way for the warm tones of sweet
                potatoes, chestnuts and pumpkins. Days become shorter, the blue of the sky is more vibrant to mark the arrival of cold 
                weather, and the sunsets become redder.<br><br>
                As people we also adapt our daily doings acording to these changes. We eat warmer food, we go home earlier and change our
                wardrobes. Here are a few things I like to do when autumn comes.<br><br>

                It's raining cats and dogs outside and you have no umbrella with you. The temperature outside dropped down suddenly. As you run down the street seeking shelter from the rain you notice a new coffe shop. You enter. 
                A sweet smell fills your nostrils while you are greeted by the dimming lights. The nusic system salutes you with a jazz playlist
                that cheers you up immediately. Menawhile, the rain keeps pouring heavily outside<br><br>
                Coffee shop jazz ambience music playlists have that little something that calms you in your busy autumn days.
                Some of them even have rainy sounds to enjoy a full experience like the one described above. Whenever I had a rough day music aways calms me down and helps me sleep.<br><br>
