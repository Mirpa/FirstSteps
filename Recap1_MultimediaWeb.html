                The arrival of autumn brings with it the arrival of new colors.<br><br>
                As time goes by, the leaves of the trees turn brown and 
                orange, until they fall off. The colors of summer fruits disappear from the markets to make way for the warm tones of sweet
                potatoes, chestnuts and pumpkins. Days become shorter, the blue of the sky is more vibrant to mark the arrival of cold 
                weather, and the sunsets become redder.<br><br>
                As people we also adapt our daily doings acording to these changes. We eat warmer food, we go home earlier and change our
                wardrobes. Here are a few things I like to do when autumn comes.<br><br>
            </strong></p>

        <div id="music">

            <p>
                It's raining cats and dogs outside and you have no umbrella with you. The temperature outside dropped down suddenly. As you run down the street seeking shelter from the rain you notice a new coffe shop. You enter. 
                A sweet smell fills your nostrils while you are greeted by the dimming lights. The nusic system salutes you with a jazz playlist
                that cheers you up immediately. Menawhile, the rain keeps pouring heavily outside<br><br>
                Coffee shop jazz ambience music playlists have that little something that calms you in your busy autumn days.
                Some of them even have rainy sounds to enjoy a full experience like the one described above. Whenever I had a rough day music aways calms me down and helps me sleep.<br><br>

            </h2>
            <p>
                Nothing beats the aroma of autumn vegetables just baked. Except maybe their versatility<br><br>
                Doesn't matter what time of the day. Whether you are in the mood for something sweet (like dessert) or something hot and 
                savory (like a pur√©e). The number of combinations is incredible<br><br>
                When this time of the year comes I like to enjoy a good homemade pumpkin spice latte. But to be honest, I fancy all kind of meals
                cooked with potatoes or sweet potatoes. Vegetable soup made with sweet potatoes is incredibly yummy. Pumpkin bread is also a 
                delicacy. But if you want to impress your guests try making some panellets!<br><br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="paint">
            <h2 id="headerPaint">
                <i class="fa fa-paint-brush"></i>&nbsp;Paint
            </h2>
            <p>
                Street floors turn into colorful carpets. Reds, oranges, browns and yellows merge while covering towns and 
                cities. Any autumn landscape makes for a good painting practice.<br><br>
                From the tiniest leave to the biggest mountain, what may seem monochromatic at the beginning turns into a mosaic made of warm colors.<br><br>
                Taking a brush, tracing the shapes and trying to match the colors, sometimes the simplest things bring me peace. 
                When combined with good music the results are mesmerizing.<br><br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="walk">
            <h2 id="headerWalk">
                <i class="fa fa-images"></i>&nbsp;Hiking
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes we tend to associate autumn with a depressive season because in most cases cames after summer holidays.<br><br>
                But actually it's the best time to take time for yourself and explore the world! Lower temperatures invite you to 
                put on some jackets and walk/hike without sweating too much.<br><br>
                Invite some friends, grab a camera, and bring with you a hot beverage in a thermo. There's no need to overdo it, 
                whether you want to enjoy sea views from the sand or go to the nearest hill, breathe and embrace the slight coldness.<br><br>
